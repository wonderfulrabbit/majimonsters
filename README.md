## How to use the automated level up options (optional)
At each level up, you get the options to choose a new technique, trait or technique upgrade. The system shows the options available but you have to add them manually. Here is how you add that information:
- To add the techniques you can lear, drag the techniques to the progression tab of the monste
- To add the optional traits, also drag it to the progression tab. The name has to include the grade like this: name (grade #)
  - For example: Smoke (Grade 2)
- To add the traits you pick according to your class, you have to add the name of the class in the progression tab, that way it will search for the correct compendium
  - For example: alchemist, concordant, etc
- To add the general traits, general technique upgrades and the traits of each class, create the following compendiums:
  -  Traits
  -  Technique upgrades
  -  For each class, create a compendium with its name plus traits. *For example: alchemist traits, concordant traits, etc*
- Fill these compendiums with the corresponding features
